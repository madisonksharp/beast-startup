## Dev Essentials

- Intro
  - Well rounded engineers
    - Capable
    - creative
    - collaborative
    - curious
- Git
  - Allows you to track versions of files in a directory
  - Handling merging conflicts
    - open test.md in an editor
  - forks
    - allows you to crete a copy
- History of web programming
  - 3 phases in history
    1. formation of the internet that supports the comm of web apps
    1. the creation of HTML and HTTP making it possible to share hyperlinked docs
    1. Creation of CSS and JavaScript to enable interactive web apps
- Technology Stack
  - Tech Stack = collection of technologies you use to create or deliver your web app.
    - top of the stack is the web framework
      - then backend services zB caching, database, logging, monnitoring
- **AWS**

## HTTP

- HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  - HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the World Wide Web. It's the foundation of data communication on the internet.
- _Client-Server model_
  - The client sends an HTTP request to the server, which then responds with the requested resource (such as a webpage or a file).
- HTTP is stateless, meaning that each request from a client to a server is independent and unrelated to any previous requests. The server doesn't retain information about past requests.
- HTTP operates through a request-response cycle. A client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server specifying the desired action, such as retrieving a webpage. The server then processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested resource, along with an appropriate status code.
- HTTP can be augmented with security protocols like HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which encrypts data exchanged between the client and server, providing a secure channel for communication.

### Caddy

Is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Then serves up the requested static files or routes to another web service - is called a gateway or reverse proxy

- basically a really smart sign maker. helps your site get notices on the internet by making it easy for people to find and access it.
- easy setup : you tell it what the site is called and where it is located
- automatic : does a lot of the work automatically so the website is fast, safe and reliable
- security : is a security guard for the site
- fast delivery: helps the website deliver its content fast
- flexible: Adapts to different situations so useful lots
- **Important Caddy Files**
  - Configuration file : ~/Caddyfile
    - contains definitions for routing HTTP requests recieved
    - to determine location where static HTML files are loaded from.
  - HTML files: ~/public_html
    - directory of files caddy serves up when requests are made

## HTTPS, TLS and Web Certificates

- HTTPS: Secure version of HTTP
- makes sure that the data being exchanged is encrypted

### TLS

Transport layer Security

- establishes a secure connection btw your browser and web server BEFORE any data is exchanged

### Web certificates

Generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key enctryption

- certificate issuer verifies that cert owner actually owns the domain name on cert.

**Shell into production environment**

- is like a magic portal allowing you to step into the place where everything important happens
- Why tho?
  - sometimes you need to make changes or fix things directly in the production environment. allows you to troubleshoot issues without disrupting the live service

## DNS (Domain Name System )

a decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet. It translates domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses, making it easier to access resources on the internet.

- Domain names are organized hierarchically, with each level separated by dots. For example, in the domain name "www.example.com":
  - "com" is the top-level domain (TLD).
  - "example" is the second-level domain.
  - "www" is the subdomain.

# deploying to production

- Use the deployFiles.sh script found in the example code to deploy Simon to your production environment. Take some time to understand how the script works. The script does three things. Deletes any previous deployment for simon, copies up all of the files found in the project directory, and makes sure Caddy is hosting the files under the simon subdomain of your domain (e.g. simon.yourdomain.click).

## CSS

makes the skeleton prettier

# 3 ways to associate CSS with HTMl

1. use style attribute and assign a declaration

   - style = "color:green" etc

1. HTML style element to define the rules within the HTML doc
1. link element

## JavaScript

Javascript Intro
JavaScript is a weakly typed language based on concepts in C, Java and Scheme.

- Typically JS is executed using an interpreter at runtime instead of compiling it into a machine specific binary at build time.
- Makes it very portable'
- But allows for many errors

# Getting Started

- Console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'world');
  - Console.log is the runtime built in function to output the string into the debugger console
- Can write functions
  - Function join(a,b){
    Return a + ' ' +b;
    }
- Comments
  - // line comment
  - /_ block comment _/

# JavaScript Console

- JS console object provides interaction with JS runtimes debugger console

- Log
  - The usage of the console object is to output a log message
    - Console.log('hello');
  - Output: hello
    - Can create formatted messages in the log parameter - Console.log('hello %s', 'world');
      - Output: hello world
- Timers
  â—‹ To see how long a piece of code is running wrap it with time and timeend
  Â§ Console.time('demo time');
  Â§ Console.timeEnd('demo time');
- Count
  â—‹ See how many times a block of code is called use count fucntion
  Â§ Console.count('a');

Adding JavaScript to HTML

- Insert either by putting directly into HTML within a <script> element or using src attribute to reference external JS file

JavaScript type and construct

- Declaring variables
  â—‹ Variables aare declared using either let or const
  Â§ Let x = 1;
  â–¡ Allows you to change value
  Â§ Const y = 2;
  â–¡ Const will cause an error if you attempt to change it
  â—‹ Avoid using var
- Type
  â—‹ Javascript doesnâ€™t enforce the declaration of a variable before use
  Â§ Null
  â–¡ Type of variable that has not been assigned a value
  Â§ Undefined
  â–¡ Not been defined
  Â§ Boolean
  â–¡ True or false
  Â§ Number
  â–¡ 64 bit signed number
  Â§ BigInt
  â–¡ Number of arbitrary magnitude
  Â§ String
  â–¡ Textual sequence of characters
  Â§ Symbol
  â–¡ Unique value
  Â§ Object
  â–¡ Collection of properties represented by name value pairs
  Â® {a:3, b:'fish'}
  Â§ Function
  â–¡ Object that has the ability to be called
  Â® Function a(){}
  Â§ Date
  â–¡ Calendar dates and times
  Â® new Date('1995-12-17')
  Â§ Array
  â–¡ An ordered sequence of any type
  Â® [3, 'fish']
  Â§ Map
  â–¡ Collection of key value pairs that support efficient lookups
  Â® New Map()
  Â§ JSON
  â–¡ A lightweight data-interchange format used to share informationa ccross programs
- Common operators
  â—‹ + (add)
  â—‹ Subtract -
  â—‹ Multiply \*
  â—‹ Divide /
  â—‹ === equality

- Type conversions
  â—‹ Strict equality === is preferred
- Conditionals
  â—‹ If, else and if else
  â—‹ Ternary operator
  Â§ A === 1 ? Console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
  â—‹ Boolean operations in expression
  Â§ && (and)
  Â§ || (or)
  Â§ ! (not)
  â–¡ Example
  Â® If (true && (!false || true)){
  }
- Loops
  â—‹ For
  Â§ For (let i=0, i<2; i++){
  Console.log(i);
  â—‹ Do while
  â—‹ For in
  â—‹ For of
  â—‹ While
  â—‹ Switch
  â—‹ Break and continue

JavaScript String

- Strings are specified by putting letters with ' , ", or `

- Unicode support
  â—‹ JavaScript supports unicode by defining a string
- String functions
  â—‹ Length
  â—‹ indexOf()
  â—‹ Split()
  â—‹ startsWith()
  â—‹ endsWith()
  â—‹ toLowerCase()
  Functions
- In JS functions are first class objects
  â—‹ That means they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array like any other variable
- Basic syntax
  â—‹ Function nameoffunction (){
  }
- Function parameters
  â—‹ When a function is called the caller may choose parameters
  Â§ If parameter is not provided then value is undefined

JavaScript Arrow Function

- To make the code more compact, the arrow syntax was created.
  â—‹ Arrow replaces the need for the function keyword with the symbols => after the parameter declaration
  â—‹ This is a function that takes no parameters and always returns 3
  Â§ () => 3;
- Return values
  â—‹ Arrow functions have special rules for the return keyword
