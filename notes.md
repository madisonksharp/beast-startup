## Dev Essentials

- Intro
  - Well rounded engineers
    - Capable
    - creative
    - collaborative
    - curious
- Git
  - Allows you to track versions of files in a directory
  - Handling merging conflicts
    - open test.md in an editor
  - forks
    - allows you to crete a copy
- History of web programming
  - 3 phases in history
    1. formation of the internet that supports the comm of web apps
    1. the creation of HTML and HTTP making it possible to share hyperlinked docs
    1. Creation of CSS and JavaScript to enable interactive web apps
- Technology Stack
  - Tech Stack = collection of technologies you use to create or deliver your web app.
    - top of the stack is the web framework
      - then backend services zB caching, database, logging, monnitoring
- **AWS**

## HTTP

- HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  - HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the World Wide Web. It's the foundation of data communication on the internet.
- _Client-Server model_
  - The client sends an HTTP request to the server, which then responds with the requested resource (such as a webpage or a file).
- HTTP is stateless, meaning that each request from a client to a server is independent and unrelated to any previous requests. The server doesn't retain information about past requests.
- HTTP operates through a request-response cycle. A client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server specifying the desired action, such as retrieving a webpage. The server then processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested resource, along with an appropriate status code.
- HTTP can be augmented with security protocols like HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which encrypts data exchanged between the client and server, providing a secure channel for communication.

### Caddy

Is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Then serves up the requested static files or routes to another web service - is called a gateway or reverse proxy

- basically a really smart sign maker. helps your site get notices on the internet by making it easy for people to find and access it.
- easy setup : you tell it what the site is called and where it is located
- automatic : does a lot of the work automatically so the website is fast, safe and reliable
- security : is a security guard for the site
- fast delivery: helps the website deliver its content fast
- flexible: Adapts to different situations so useful lots
- **Important Caddy Files**
  - Configuration file : ~/Caddyfile
    - contains definitions for routing HTTP requests recieved
    - to determine location where static HTML files are loaded from.
  - HTML files: ~/public_html
    - directory of files caddy serves up when requests are made

### HTTPS, TLS and Web Certificates

- HTTPS: Secure version of HTTP
- makes sure that the data being exchanged is encrypted

### TLS

Transport layer Security

- establishes a secure connection btw your browser and web server BEFORE any data is exchanged

### Web certificates

Generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key enctryption

- certificate issuer verifies that cert owner actually owns the domain name on cert.

**Shell into production environment**

- is like a magic portal allowing you to step into the place where everything important happens
- Why tho?
  - sometimes you need to make changes or fix things directly in the production environment. allows you to troubleshoot issues without disrupting the live service

## Console Commands

### DNS (Domain Name System )

a decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet. It translates domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses, making it easier to access resources on the internet.

- Domain names are organized hierarchically, with each level separated by dots. For example, in the domain name "www.example.com":
  - "com" is the top-level domain (TLD).
  - "example" is the second-level domain.
  - "www" is the subdomain.

### Canvas element

#### deploying to production

- Use the deployFiles.sh script found in the example code to deploy Simon to your production environment. Take some time to understand how the script works. The script does three things. Deletes any previous deployment for simon, copies up all of the files found in the project directory, and makes sure Caddy is hosting the files under the simon subdomain of your domain (e.g. simon.yourdomain.click).

## CSS

Flex is used to delimit the header, main, and footer elements. This makes them responsive to different screen sizes.
The use of absolute positioning relative to the parent element for the game controls.
The selection based on class attributes to style elements.
The override of Bootstrap in order to keep the menu from changing the flex direction to column on small screens.
The use of @media selectors to hide content when the screen is too small.

makes the skeleton prettier

### CSS box model

![Box model](images/Screenshot%202024-02-26%20at%2014.58.59.jpeg)

### 3 ways to associate CSS with HTMl

  to move stuff around with smaller and bigger screens

### Grid

useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid

- container element

### Flexbox

display: flex;

- Useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes.

### Frameworks

- Tailwind
- Bootstrap
  - reference the url

## JavaScript

Javascript Intro
JavaScript is a weakly typed language based on concepts in C, Java and Scheme.

- Typically JS is executed using an interpreter at runtime instead of compiling it into a machine specific binary at build time.
- Makes it very portable'
- But allows for many errors

### Getting Started

- Console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'world');
  - Console.log is the runtime built in function to output the string into the debugger console
- Can write functions
  - Function join(a,b){
    Return a + ' ' +b;
    }
- Comments
  - // line comment
  - /_ block comment _/

### JavaScript Console

- JS console object provides interaction with JS runtimes debugger console

- Log
  - The usage of the console object is to output a log message
    - Console.log('hello');
  - Output: hello
    - Can create formatted messages in the log parameter - Console.log('hello %s', 'world');
      - Output: hello world
- Timers
  To see how long a piece of code is running wrap it with time and timeend
  -
  - Console.time('demo time');
  - Console.timeEnd('demo time');
- Count
  ○ See how many times a block of code is called use count fucntion
  § Console.count('a');

### Adding JavaScript to HTML

- Insert either by putting directly into HTML within a <script> element or using src attribute to reference external JS file

JavaScript type and construct

- Declaring variables
  - Variables aare declared using either let or const
  - Let x = 1;
  - Allows you to change value
    - Const y = 2;
  - Const will cause an error if you attempt to change it
    - Avoid using var
- Type
  - Javascript doesn’t enforce the declaration of a variable before use
  - Null
    Type of variable that has not been assigned a value
  - Undefined: Not been defined
  - Boolean: True or false
  - Number: 64 bit signed number
  - BigInt: Number of arbitrary magnitude
  - String: Textual sequence of characters
  - Symbol: Unique value
  - Object: Collection of properties represented by name value pairs
  - Function: Object that has the ability to be called :
  - Date: Calendar dates and times: new Date('1995-12-17')
  - Array: An ordered sequence of any type
  - Map: Collection of key value pairs that support efficient lookups
    - New Map()
  - JSON: A lightweight data-interchange format used to share informationa ccross programs
- Common operators

  - +(add)
  - Subtract -
  - Multiply \*
  - Divide /
  - === equality

- Type conversions
  - Strict equality === is preferred
- Conditionals
  - If, else and if else
  - Ternary operator
    - A === 1 ? Console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
  - Boolean operations in expression
    - && (and)
    - || (or)
    - ! (not)
  - Example
    If (true && (!false || true)){
    }
- Loops
  - For
    - For (let i=0, i<2; i++){
      Console.log(i);
  - Do while
  - For in
  - For of
  - While
  - Switch
  - Break and continue

### JavaScript String

- Strings are specified by putting letters with ' , ", or `

- Unicode support
  - JavaScript supports unicode by defining a string
- String functions
  - Length
  - indexOf()
  - Split()
  - startsWith()
  - endsWith()
  - toLowerCase()

### Functions

- In JS functions are first class objects
  That means they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array like any other variable
- Basic syntax
  - Function nameoffunction (){
    }
- Function parameters
  - When a function is called the caller may choose parameters
    - If parameter is not provided then value is undefined

### JavaScript Arrow Function

- To make the code more compact, the arrow syntax was created.
  - Arrow replaces the need for the function keyword with the symbols => after the parameter declaration
  - This is a function that takes no parameters and always returns 3
    § () => 3;
- Return values
  - Arrow functions have special rules for the return keyword

### Arrays

- Object functions
  - push : add an item to the end of the array- a.push()
  - pop : remove an item from the end of the array - x = a.pop()
  - slice: return a sub-array - a.slice(1,-1)
  - sort: run a function to sort an array in place - a.sort((a,b)=> b-a)
  - values: Creates an iterator for use with a for of loop- a.values..
  - find: find first item satisfied by a test function
  - forEach: run a function on each array item
  - reduce
  - map
  - filter
  - every
  - some

### this pointer

- all about scope
  closure

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

- contains an object
  - provides a simple and effective way to share and store data

Example of a JSON doc
{
"class": {
"title": "web programming",
"description": "Amazing"
},
"enrollment": ["Marco", "Jana", "فَاطِمَة"],
"start": "2025-02-01",
"end": null
}

### COnverting to JavaScript

- convert to and from javaScript using JSON.parse and JSON.stringify

- JSON.stringify(obj); - make an object a string
  JSON.parse- make string into obj
-

### JavaScript Object and classes

Objects have common object oriented functionality

- Constructors
- a this pointer
- static properties
- functions
- inheritance

#### Objects

const pet = new Pet ({Name:"bob"});
pet['type'] = "fish";
pet.sound= [1, 2, 3];
pet.hello = function (){
console.log(Name, 'barks');
};

pet.hello();
OUTPUT: Bob barks

#### Object-Literals

- Syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object
  const pet = {
  name:"bob",
  age: 5,

  }
  Basically a shorthand

- objects can be created with the new operator

#### object functions

- entries: returns an array of key value pairs
- keys: returns an array of keys
- values: returns and array of

#### Constructor

Function that returns and object

function Person(name) {
return {
name: name,
log: function () {
console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
},
};
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich

#### Regex

#### Rest

-

#### Exceptions

errors happen. exceptions are errors

think of how crazy users are going to use it

allows you to plan for the use cases

### DOM

- parses it into a structure

## Async/await

## HTTP

### Ports and protocols

- 20: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer
- 22: Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices
- 25: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email
- 53:Domain Name System (DNS) for looking up IP addresses
- 80: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests
- 110: Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email
- 123: Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time
- 161: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers
- 194: Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting
- 443: HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests

- **HTTP** stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a language computers use to communicate over the internet, like sending requests for web pages.

### Client and Server:

- **Client:** Your computer or phone.
- **Server:** The computer hosting a website.

### Request-Response Cycle:

1. You send an HTTP request to the server.
2. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.
3. Your browser interprets the response and displays the webpage.

### Parts of an HTTP Request:

- **URL:** Address of the webpage.
- **Method:** Indicates what action you want to perform (e.g., GET, POST).
- **Headers:** Additional information about the request.
- **Body:** Optional data sent to the server.

### Parts of an HTTP Response:

- **Status Code:** Indicates if the request was successful or encountered an error.
- **Headers:** Additional information from the server.
- **Body:** Content of the webpage.

### HTTP Methods:

- **GET:** Retrieve a webpage.
- **POST:** Send data to the server.
- **PUT:** Store data on the server.
- **DELETE:** Delete data from the server.

### HTTP vs. HTTPS:

- **HTTPS:** Secure version of HTTP that encrypts data for added security.

### TCP/IP layers

- application, HTTPS, functionality like web browsing
- transport, TCP, Moving connection info packets
- Internet, IP, Establishing connections
- Link, Fiber, hardware, physical connections

## HTTP requests

### What is an HTTP Request?

An HTTP request is a message sent from a client (such as a web browser) to a server, requesting information or an action to be performed.

### Parts of an HTTP Request:

1. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):**

   - Specifies the address of the resource being requested.

2. **Method:**

   - Indicates the type of action the client wants the server to perform. Common methods include:
     - `GET`: Retrieve a resource.
     - `POST`: Submit data to be processed.
     - `PUT`: Update a resource.
     - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.

3. **Headers:**

   - Additional information about the request, such as the type of browser being used or the format of the data being sent.

4. **Body (Optional):**
   - Contains additional data sent with the request. For example, when submitting a form, the form data is included in the request body.

### Example of an HTTP Request:

http
GET /example-page HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,_/_;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive

### Fetch

The fetch API is the preferred way to make HTTP requests. The fetch function is built into the browser's JavaScript runtime. This means you can call it from JavaScript code running in a browser.

The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise then function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type application/json you can use the json function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

#### **Cookies:**

- pieces of data websites store on your computer or device when you visit them. to enhance browser experience, personalize content, track activities.
- contain info like preferences, login credentials, browsing history, other data
- types: session cookies, temp cookies erased when browser closed and persistent cookies remain on device even after closing browser
- Purpose: authentication, personalization, tracking, session management

### Standard HTTP headers

#### Request headers

1. **Accept:** Specifies the types of content the client can accept.
2. **User-Agent:** Identifies the type of browser or user agent making the request.
3. **Host:** Indicates the host name and port number of the requested resource.
4. **Authorization:** Contains credentials for authenticating the client with the server.
5. **Content-Type:** Specifies the media type of the data sent in the request body (for POST and PUT requests).

#### response headers

1. **Content-Type:** Indicates the media type of the content sent in the response body.
2. **Content-Length:** Specifies the length of the response body in bytes.
3. **Cache-Control:** Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.
4. **Set-Cookie:** Sets a cookie in the client's browser with information for subsequent requests.
5. **Location:** Specifies the URL to redirect the client to (used in redirection responses like 301 and 302).

#### General Headers

1. **Date:** Specifies the date and time when the message was sent.

2. **Connection:** Controls whether the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes.
3. **Content-Encoding:** Specifies the encoding applied to the response body (e.g., gzip, deflate).
4. **Transfer-Encoding:** Specifies the form of encoding used to transfer the payload in chunks.
5. **Access-control-allow-origin** Server response of what origins can make a request. May include a wildcard

### HTTP Status Codes

#### 1xx Informational

- **100 Continue:** The server has received the initial part of the request and is waiting for the client to continue.
- **101 Switching Protocols:** The server is switching protocols as requested by the client (e.g., upgrading to WebSocket).

#### 2xx Success

- **200 OK:** The request was successful.
- **201 Created:** The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
- **204 No Content:** The server successfully processed the request but does not need to return any content.

#### 3xx Redirection

- **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
- **302 Found (or Moved Temporarily):** The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.
- **304 Not Modified:** The client's cached copy of the resource is still valid, and the server has not modified it.
- **307 Permanent Redirect**
- **308 Temporary Redirect**

#### 4xx Client Error

- **400 Bad Request:** The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized:** The request requires user authentication.
- **403 Forbidden:** The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **408 Request Timeout**
- **409 Conflict**
- **418 I'm a teapot**
- **429 too many requests**

#### 5xx Server Error

- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance.

## Web services

### Aspects of web services

### Web Server

#### Daemon

- The term daemon comes from the idea of something that is always there working in the background.
- PM2

- A computing device that is hosting a web service that knows how to accept incoming internet connections and speak the http protocol

#### Key Components of a Web Server:

1. **HTTP Server:** Handles incoming HTTP requests from clients and sends back HTTP responses containing the requested content.
2. **File System:** Stores the web content (HTML files, images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) that the server serves to clients.
3. **Configuration Files:** Define settings and parameters for the web server, such as port number, virtual hosts, and security settings.
4. **Logging Mechanism:** Records information about incoming requests, server errors, and other events for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
5. **Security Features:** Implements security measures to protect against unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and other security threats.

#### Basic Workflow of a Web Server:

1. **Listen for Incoming Requests:** The web server listens on a specified port (usually port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS) for incoming requests from clients.
2. **Process Requests:** When a request is received, the server processes it by determining the requested resource and any additional parameters (e.g., query strings).
3. **Retrieve Resources:** The server retrieves the requested resources from the file system or generates dynamic content using server-side scripting languages (e.g., PHP, Python).
4. **Generate Response:** Once the resources are obtained, the server constructs an HTTP response containing the requested content, status code, and headers.
5. **Send Response:** The server sends the HTTP response back to the client over the network.
6. **Log Events:** The server logs information about the request, response, and server-side events for monitoring, analysis, and troubleshooting.

## Domain Names

### What is a Domain Name?

A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify and access websites on the internet. It provides a memorable and meaningful way to locate specific web resources, such as websites, web pages, or email servers.

### Components of a Domain Name:

1. **Top-Level Domain (TLD):**

   - The highest level in the domain name hierarchy.
   - Examples include `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`, and country-code TLDs like `.us`, `.uk`, and `.de`.

2. **Second-Level Domain (SLD):**

   - The part of the domain name that precedes the top-level domain.
   - Represents the name of the organization, business, or entity.
   - For example, in `example.com`, "example" is the second-level domain.

3. **Subdomain:**
   - An optional prefix added to the domain name to create additional addressable sections.
   - Often used to organize and categorize content or create distinct web services.
   - For example, in `blog.example.com`, "blog" is a subdomain of `example.com`.

### Domain Name Registration:

- Domain names are registered through domain registrars, organizations accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to manage domain registrations.
- Registrants can search for available domain names and register them for a specific period, typically one to ten years, by paying a registration fee.
- Domain registration requires providing accurate contact information and adhering to domain registration policies and regulations.

### Domain Name System (DNS):

- The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed system that translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate resources on the internet.
- DNS servers maintain databases called DNS zones that store mappings between domain names and IP addresses.
- When a user enters a domain name in a web browser, the browser queries DNS servers to resolve the domain name to the corresponding IP address.

### Domain Name Extensions:

- Domain name extensions, also known as TLDs, can indicate the type, purpose, or geographical location of a website.
- Common generic TLDs include `.com` (commercial), `.org` (organization), `.net` (network), and `.info` (information).
- Specialized TLDs cater to specific industries or interests, such as `.edu` (education), `.gov` (government), and `.io` (technology startups).

### Domain Name Management:

- Domain owners can manage their domain settings, including DNS configuration, email forwarding, and WHOIS privacy, through domain registrar control panels or management interfaces.
- Regular maintenance, renewal, and monitoring of domain registrations are essential to ensure uninterrupted access to web resources and prevent domain expiration.

## Parts of a URL

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a string of characters used to specify the address of a web resource on the internet. It typically consists of several components:

1. **Scheme:**

   - The scheme indicates the protocol used to access the resource. Common schemes include `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, `mailto:`, and `file://`.

2. **Hostname:**

   - The hostname (or domain name) identifies the server that hosts the resource. It may include subdomains and the top-level domain (TLD). For example, in `www.example.com`, `www` is a subdomain, and `example.com` is the domain name.

3. **Port (Optional):**

   - The port number specifies the network port used to communicate with the server. If omitted, the default port for the specified scheme is used (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).

4. **Path:**

   - The path specifies the location of the resource on the server's filesystem or within the web application. It starts with a forward slash (/) and may consist of multiple segments separated by slashes.

5. **Query Parameters (Optional):**

   - Query parameters provide additional information to the server, typically in the form of key-value pairs. They appear after a question mark (?) and are separated by ampersands (&). For example, `?key1=value1&key2=value2`.

6. **Fragment (Optional):**
   - The fragment identifier specifies a specific section or location within the resource. It appears after a hash symbol (#) and is used primarily in HTML documents to link to specific sections of a webpage.

Here's an example of a URL with all its components:

`plaintext
https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?key1=value1&key2=value2#section1

## Database services

### DB Query

- lt = less than
- gt = greater than

/J._/: This is a regular expression pattern enclosed in forward slashes (/). In MongoDB, when you use regular expressions in queries, you typically use them to match against string values.
J._: This regular expression pattern means:
J: Match the letter "J" exactly.
._: Match zero or more of any character (except newline). So ._ means match any string of characters.
